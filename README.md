OrderForm
=========

A simple PHP Order form that takes values from the options and adds them together to get a final price.

========================================================================================================================

This Project takes a web form where users can select options for a product and uses a php script to read and total the 
Price of the selected add ons. This script will also log the info into a database and send an email to verify and to the 
owner.

(sorry if that is confusing)
